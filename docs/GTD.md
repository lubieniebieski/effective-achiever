# GTD

Getting Things Done - the framework.

## Next action

Probably the most important thing in the GTD methodology is to change your way of perceiving tasks. The system says it clear: it has to be actionable and easy to understand, a simple command is the best.

Some examples:

```markdown
* Sell the car [Project]
	* Wash the car
	* Take some photos of the car from every angle
	* Browse ads about the same model and get the price estimate for the car
	* Call your mechanic (Trevor: 1-2333-4440) and ask him about important facts about the car which should be mentioned in the ad
	* Put the ad on www.sellyourcar.com
```

As you can see - the project itself might sound like a big thing, but each of the corresponding tasks is easy to understand and actionable, you can just go one by one and… sell your car.

## Inbox

Have a place where you capture ideas and tasks as they occur to you. The way you put things in the inbox should be simple and always available. You want to get things out of your brain as fast as possible.

Some examples:

* Notes.app
* Sheet of paper
* Plastic box

## Weekly review

The goal of weekly review (going through your tasks) is to:

* Make sure each project has at least one next action.
* Make sure that each action on your next actions list is actually something you want or need to do. It’s very common to just remove tasks during weekly review because they don’t make sense anymore (Be honest with yourself.)
* Look through your someday/maybe list and see if some projects/actions should be moved to the list of current projects/the next actions list.

## Deferring

All tasks have a date when they should be visible to you. For instance, the tasks about changing your tires in your car for winter season shouldn’t occupy your mind until September or so. When the given month comes, you should see the project "Change tires in your car" and take a look at weather prognosis and act on this, or to defer the project for another week or two.

## Contexts

Some tasks/projects are useful in some contexts. Some of them might be related to context "work" or "home". Another common context is "phone" - imagine you’re in the position when you have a few minutes because you’re waiting on a parking lot, you just browse through "phone" context and make the calls.

## 2-min rule

If you’re about to add the task to your inbox but it requires a minimal amount of time for you (2-5 minutes is a good rule of thumb) - just do it.
