# Mindset

## If something bothers you - get rid of that

We tend to ignore things that bother us. We should act instead and remove these things from our environment so our brain doesnâ€™t have to exclude it.

* Twitter people
	* Too much noise
	* Not-relevant content

* Slack channels
	* Youâ€™re not needed anymore
	* Too much noise

* Subscriptions
	* Not relevant anymore
	* Donâ€™t archive, unsubscribe instead!

## Automate

Even if youâ€™re not programmer - you can still automate a lot of things. You can find a few platforms below - they might be used to connect dozens of diffrent apps with each other and use the combinations which would never be possible out of the box.

### Examples

* Star in Gmail -\> Task in Jira
* Trello due date added to a card â€”\> Add an event in a calendar
* Calendar meeting in progress -\> Set Slack status to "Busy"
* New response from a Google Form â€”\> Add selected details to anotherâ€™s team spreadsheet
* Someone visited our page for the 50th time -\> Send them an email with a link to our career page and invitation for a hangout

## Read more

We live in a beautiful times - we have access to so many great people, their thinking, experiences and lessons. If you want to focus or research something - you just get a book and learn about the topic.

A good idea is to read multiple books at once:

* one which requires a lot of your attention (like technical books)
* one which is outside of your domain but can broaden your perspective
* one for entertainment

Depending on your state - you just pick one book from the pile above and youâ€™re good to go!

## Ask questions

Use other people experience to achieve your own goals - thereâ€™s no better way of choosing an optimal path or learn about the obstacles other than asking people whoâ€™ve walked this path already.

## Observe other people setups and workflows

As we work together with other people, no matter if in person, or remotely - we often see how our colleagues work, what are they clicking, how does their web/terminal look like, how do they jump between tasks/apps, what apps do they use.

Combine what you see with questions and you can improve your environment a lot!

## Have a growth mindset

According to researcher Carol Dweck, there are two types of mindsets: a fixed mindset and a growth mindset.

In a fixed mindset, people believe their qualities are fixed traits and therefore cannot change. These people document their intelligence and talents rather than working to develop and improve them. They also believe that talent alone leads to success, and effort is not required.

Alternatively, in a growth mindset, people have an underlying belief that their learning and intelligence can grow with time and experience. When people believe they can get smarter, they realise that their effort has an effect on their success, so they put in extra time, leading to higher achievement.

## Always put the ball in someone else's hands

When thereâ€™s a task that involves multiple people, try to finish your part as soon as possible. Youâ€™ll be able to move the responsibility to someone else and give your brain some additional resources to consume in some other way.

## Use mentions where possible and be precise

Mentions are used for directly pinging someone, or letting them know that they should read about something. Itâ€™s very easy for us to miss out some information, because thereâ€™s plenty of information around us in all the places.

### When to use mentions?

* If you will someone should read something
* If someone should respond to you
* If you want someoneâ€™s attention

There is a lot of places where you can use mentions:

* Slack, along with group mentions
* Jira
* Google Docs
* Gmail
* Github, along with team mentions

## Set your 3 top priorities in the morning

You can tweak your brain to focus on whatâ€™s important by doing a simple job - write down (digitally or on paper) your 3 priorities for the day - starting from the most critical one.

The goal is to do at least the first thing, your brain will help you by doing this exercise.

## Be lean about your work

Remove things you shouldnâ€™t do in the first place.
