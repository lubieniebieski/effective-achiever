# Task managers

**Pain**: you have something in work, something else for personal things.
Itâ€™s ok - because your brain will learn to use them together with a given context

You can think about it like this:

* use Jira at work
* use OmniFocus for personal things
* use Trello/Todoist for shared tasks outside work

There are a few tools worth mentioning:

* OmniFocus
* Things
* Todoist
* Trello
* Jira
* Google Keeps
