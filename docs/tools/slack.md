## Using shortcuts

This is the essence - if you spend a lot of time in Slack, using shortcuts is a
must. Let's focus on the most important ones:

* `CMD+K` - open a new conversation

## `biz-*` and `project-*` channels

Treat them as stop&go places. As soon as you're done with your business, just
leave the channel. They will invite you back if you're needed.
