# Slack

Our favourite communication tool! :)

* You can find an external [Slack focus guide][1] which talks about the things mentioned here and more

## Starring messages and automating it

If you use an external TODO application, like OmniFocus, Jira, Wunderlist, Todoist, etc. - you can use a simple trick to keep track of important conversations.

The main idea is that when you need to get back to the conversation in a more structured way (have some time to think, etc.) - you star this message and it’s going to be automatically added to your application of choice. Very useful and a nice addition to "Remind me about it..." function which works similarly but in a different context.

## Optimising the UI

### Start important channels and conversations

Starred channels are going to be disabled on top and always visible - if you want to keep track of what’s going on on these channels - star them.

### Change sidebar settings to only see starred channels and unread messages

You really don’t need to see all the channels, leave conversations which are unread or starred. If by any chance you need something else - use the previous tip - star conversations and get back to them via your TODO app.

## Disabling notifications

Start with disabling the sound and make sure you don’t see the pop-up as well. Both these notifications create distractions and you don’t need them to have a productive work.

## Using shortcuts

This is the essence - if you spend a lot of time in Slack, using shortcuts is a
must. Let's focus on the most important ones:

* `CMD + /` - open keyboard shortcuts panel (mother of all shortcuts)
* `CMD + K` - jump to a user, conversation, channel, etc. - sorted automagically - huge time saver
* `CMD + [` & `CMD + ]` - jump to next/previous conversation
* `SHIFT + ESC` - mark all messages as read

## `biz-*` and `project-*` channels (conventions)

Treat them as stop&go places. As soon as you're done with your business, just leave the channel. They will invite you back if you're needed. Of course, say something like "_I’m leaving, please mention me if needed_".

Each channel like this has its own purpose and rules.
