# Calendar

The tips mentioned here are general and not limited do Google Calendar only.

## Color-code your calendar

Use colors to mark the importance/character of your meetings. The main benefit is that at the first glance - you’re prepared for the entire week and see which days you need to focus more and when can you do some less-critical work and "absorb" more appointments.

🔴 **RED**

* Highest priority
* Most important meetings of the week either external or internal

💜 **GRAPE**

* Recurring meetings, like O3s, daily standups, etc. We should stick with times, etc

🔵 **DEFAULT** (I like blue as default)

* just "meetings"
* preparation not required on your end
* They are movable and you use those event to make some time in my calendar when needed
* Also meetings which are in question, you’re no 100% committed to them (either to attend them or to do them at a specified time)

💚 **GREEN**

* Meetings which are nice to haves, most of the time outside of work scope. Playing some sport or attending an event.

🌚 **GRAY**

* maintenance tasks
* rather not-movable
* threat them as blocks of time when you’re not available

You can see how it looks in practice:

## Use emojis in your event titles

Who doesn't like to see a 🍔 icon in your lunch description or a 🚗 when you’re commuting to the office? Moreover, you can signal important events with a ❗️ or mark recurring meeting with a 🔄.

On Mac, all you have to do is to edit the title, press `CTRL + CMD + SPACE` and the window with emoji will appear - you just pick the interesting one and you’re good to go.

## Create time-slots for creative work

Paul Graham wrote a great post back in 2009 [Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Software][1] where he lays out the difference between the manager’s and the maker’s schedule. The manager’s schedule will sound familiar to many of you — a day full of meetings, appointments, and coordination — while the maker, or the creative, needs stretches of uninterrupted time in which you can let your mind both wander and focus and get into a flow.

Depending on your style - you can block some time in the morning, put that in the calendar and let other know that you’re going to use this time to maximise your flow and get your job done without interruptions.

## Set your availability

If you plan to take a day off or you need to leave few hours earlier - put that in the calendar. In case of questions, your colleagues will know that your not available and it won’t be a surprise.

In case of part remote, part on-site work - a good idea is to add an all-day event to your calendar as well (**TIP**: set the event as free, so your calendar is not blocker) saying something like: "@ Warsaw Office". Other people will know that they can catch you in the office and grab a coffee or lunch with you (or discuss some important things).

## Set your working hours

Google Calendar comes with a handy feature which allows you to set working hours - if someone is trying to schedule a meeting with you outside of these hours - they will receive a warning.

## Schedule time for recurring events/things

The common case is that you need to write a summary of some kind every week or have a chat with someone. Put that in the calendar as recurring item and use the time to complete it. It works better when the time is set in the calendar, we often miss things that are in our TODO list but aren't scheduled.
