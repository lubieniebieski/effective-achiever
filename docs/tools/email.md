# E-mail

## Inbox 0

**Keep your inbox empty!**

1. Archive everything
2. Respond to messages right away if the response takes you less than 2 mins
3. Star messages which requires your attention and treat them separately as "Action Required"
	4. You can also set some automation so starred emails are added as tasks in your TODO app

## Check your e-mail only a couple times a day

E-mail by definition is an asynchronous tool of exchanging messages. If someone needs something ASAP, you‚Äôll know about it in a different way than by email in 99% of the cases.

Good schedule might be:
1. AM session: there are some emails to address from yesterday
2. Around lunch session
3. PM session: see what happened today, respond or plan work for tomorrow

This is going to work if you keep your Inbox Zero routine going. Might seem hard in the beginning, but it works, really.

## Know e-mail shortcuts

If you use Gmail then there are some key keyboard shortcuts which will make your life much easier.

* ``j` & `k`` - jump to next/previous message
* `g then i` - go to Inbox
* `g then l` - go to label ...
* `r` - reply
* `a` - reply to all
* `f` - forward
* `e` - archive

## Use filters

‚ùóÔ∏è Don't use filters locally, instead of writing the filters in some app (Mail.app, etc.) - use Google Mail for that. Thanks to that, your rules will always be with you, no matter which tool you use.

Gmail offers a handy feature of creating filters based on the message attributes. You may find a few ideas below:
* if message comes from `github.com` add label `github` and remove it from Inbox
* if message is addressed to main email communication email in the company, never delete it from the Inbox

## Unsubscribe

A lot of people use filters mentioned above to remove the content they don‚Äôt want to see anymore. There‚Äôs better way of decluttering your Inbox.

One of the best things you can do with most of the newsletters is to... unsubscribe from them. Search for "UNSUBSCRIBE" email at the bottom of a given e-mail. Having some extra mental capacity is always a plus!

Besides, admit that you don't really read those newsletters, do you?
