# E-mail

## Check your times only a couple times a day

## Inbox 0

## Know e-mail shortcuts

## Use filters

* Don't use filters locally, instead of writing the filters in some app
(Mail.app, etc.) - use Google Mail for that. Thanks to that, your rules will
always be with you, no matter which tool you use.

## Unsubscribe

One of the best things you can do with most of the newsletters is to...
unsubscribe from them. Search for "UNSUBSCRIBE" email at the bottom of a given
e-mail. Having some extra mental capacity is always a plus!

Besides, admit that you don't really read those newsletters, do you?
