# General

## Weekly review

Every week, sit down for 15-30 minutes and think about past 7 days and about the week in front of you.

### Structure

You can use the following structure to go through the review:

* Wins
* Lessons learned
* Things to share
* What am I happy with
* Goals for the next week

## Establish communication channels and time for responses

This should be aligned with your team:

* **E-mail**
	* 2-3 days
* **Comment/mention inside your project-related tool (Jira, Github, etc.)**
	* 2â€“3 hour response time (i.e, same day response)
* **Slack**
	* 2â€“3 hour response time (i.e, same day response)
* **Messages/Whatsapp/SMS**
	* ASAP
* **Phone call**
	* Immediate

## Measure your time

Use some tools for that, e.g. [https://www.rescuetime.com][1].

Install the tool, get back to it after few weeks and youâ€™re going to be surprised how do you spend your time. If there is something in the results what bothers you - set some limits for a given task. Example:

* If you feel you spend too much time in e-mail, follow the rules from **E-mail** section and check your Inbox only a few times a day
* If you see a lot of Slack and not enough Code Editor window -\> try to experiment with Slack notifications so you can focus on your primary task

## Consume the Internet wisely

Internet is too big. Instead of spending time with reading every new thing on Twitter or Reddit, invest your time in digested emails.

## Use keyboard shortcuts everywhere

It saves a lot of time, here are a couple general ones, available in almost every app:

* `CMD + ,` : Options
* `CMD + f` : Go to full screen
* `CMD + [` : Previous task/page/state

## Use a window-manager

Itâ€™s especially useful when youâ€™re on the call and you want to see the team and meeting notes in the same time. By pushing two keystrokes, your screen is divided in a half and youâ€™ve done your job.

## Make your clipboard size bigger

In order to become a copy/paste master, you need to grow your clipboard size. Thereâ€™s a lot of apps offering something like this.

## Fast keyboard and fast mouse

If you deal a lot with text of all kinds, youâ€™ll see the results immediately. The goal is to speed up the process of moving the cursor around or removing some text from the paragraph.

## Notifications

Turn them **OFF**.

Especially pop-ups and sound notifications.

## Physical tips

* Have an additional cable for charging your phone always in your bag.
* Have a bottle/glass of water on your desk and drink it regularly. Itâ€™s good for your health. It also enforces you to move (either to fill in the glass or empty your stomach).
